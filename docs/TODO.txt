- APP:
    - Write user automation scripts (that performs the manual labor for the user)
    - Work our LOCAL-AWS paths
    - Include data versioning and annotations
    - Format train.py
- REPO: rename to xgbutler-mlops
- README
    - Intro:
        - Implement clickable table of contents
    - Data:
        - Describe lack of pre-processing because data is highly idiosyncratic
        - Thus user data should be *pre-processed* before ingestion
        - Works only with parquet files (web/local)
        - For the moment only works with *binary target*
    - Predictions:
        - Model retraining is done based on delayed ground truth (agents gather new labeled data on the field)
    - PS:
        - Describe how I lack inclination towards MLOPS if purpose is lacking
- Unit Tests:
    - app.ipynb
    - train.ipynb
    - mageai/poleng/utils/supports.py (?)

# Create an app that automatically runs an mlops pipeline for an XGBoost study
# UPDATE > not that of a good idea... app is too restrictive to be usable 
# EX: param optimization, only xgboost, binary, classfication...
# 

# The app should have the following features:
    - Experiment tracking and model registry (MLFLOW)
    - Workflow orchestration (MAGEAI)
    - Monitoring (EVIDENTLY, GRAFANA...)
    - CI/CD 
        - Unit Tests
        - Integration Tests
        - Code Formatter (LINTER, BLACK...)
        - CLI Support (Makefile)
        - Pre-commit hooks (GIT)
    - Local & Cloud deployment
