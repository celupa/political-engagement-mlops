- FEATURES:
    - Code Formatter (LINTER, BLACK...)
    - CLI Support (Makefile)
    - Pre-commit hooks (GIT)
    
    - Re-work app to use custom user data (is this even feasible?)
    - Implement cloud deployment (+ config files)
    - Include data versioning and annotations
    - Create Global Data Product returning mlflow artifacts and live_data only once (mageai)
- APP:
    - Write Unit & Integration Test (substitued by pseudo-integration test pulse_check.py)
- README
    - Intro:
        - Implement clickable table of contents
    - Data:
        - Describe lack of pre-processing because data is highly idiosyncratic
        - Thus user data should be *pre-processed* before ingestion
        - Works only with parquet files (web/local)
        - For the moment only works with *binary target*
    - Predictions:
        - Model retraining is done based on delayed ground truth (agents gather new labeled data on the field)
    - PS:
        - Describe how I lack inclination towards MLOPS if purpose is lacking
