# TODO:
    - APP:
        - Implement exit function
    - REPO: rename to xgbutler-mlops
    - README
        - Intro:
            - Implement clickable table of contents
        - Data:
            - Describe lack of pre-processing because data is highly idiosyncratic
            - Thus user data should be *pre-processed* before ingestion
            - Works only with parquet files (web/local)
            - For the moment only works with *binary target*

# Create an app that automatically runs an mlops pipeline for an XGBoost study

# The app should have the following features:
    - Experiment tracking and model registry (MLFLOW)
    - Workflow orchestration (MAGEAI)
    - Monitoring (EVIDENTLY, GRAFANA...)
    - CI/CD 
        - Unit Tests
        - Integration Tests
        - Code Formatter (LINTER, BLACK...)
        - CLI Support (Makefile)
        - Pre-commit hooks (GIT)
    - Local & Cloud deployment
